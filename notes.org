*** targeting weight
*** damage descriptions
*** damage received
*** "effective" length
** What varies?
*** "effective" length varies real time
*** descriptions vary by body part type
eyes, head, etc are the same
could create a bunch of descriptions? separate from the body parts?
target size could vary from one template to the next. a googley-eyed
monster might have a better
*** templates
**** humanoid
**** quadriped
* describe generic function
* soul binding
** you have lived many lives

throw dirt in eyes?
*** grass

*** water
*** flammability
* scenarios
** start a fire, set entire area on fire
* events
** examples
*** health changes
*** ap changes
*** room changes - people enter/exit
*** chat
*** movement w/in room
*** looking
*** doing actions - sit, stand, get something
*** engagement - get close enough to creature, it attacks
** example flow
*** Rob enters room occupied by Violet
*** Violet is engaged with a Giant
*** Rob should get the current state of:
**** the positions of all in the room
**** the giant's health
*** 
** possible architectures
*** more knowledge of observers
**** bodies "know" they need to notify rooms
all observed actions go to the body's room, which is a slot
**** rooms "know" they need to notify bodies
all notifications iterate over the list of bodies in the room. the
list is stored in a slot
**** room registration consists of updating above slots
*** less knowledge of observers
**** bodies are completely unaware of the nature of their observers
**** rooms are the "locus of control" when it comes to creating observers
**** drawback: have to create and destroy observers when the only thing changing is the room
** observer structure
*** make a method observable
**** before value
**** after value
** event structure
*** what does the browser need?
**** object which has changed
***** body
***** room
**** which attribute of the object changed
**** the new value of the attribute
*** examples
**** room
***** (room 'bodies (p1 p2 p3))
***** (room 'items (i1 i2 i3))
**** body
***** (body 'health 20)
***** (body 'maxhealth 2
*** OR send new entire structure, but just with affected attributes
*** ex:
(body
  (body-parts
    (left-arm
      (damage-received
        (slice 10))))
  (health 10))

(room (bodies (b1 b2 b3))
