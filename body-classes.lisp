;; Bodies
;; ======
;; 
;; Each body is composed of body parts
;;
;; Each body part has a prototype
;; 
;; The prototype is a global object with invariant data, like
;; targeting weight and damage descriptions. For example, all eyeballs
;; should have the same descriptions when they've sustained the same
;; degree of damage.
;;
;; The body part object contains instance-specific data, like how much
;; damage is actually sustained
;;
;; Each time a body is created, new body parts are composed with their
;; prototypes using body templates. A human would have a different
;; template from a spider.

;; TODO add in a body graph to handle height
;; each node is a body part, each edge value is length?
